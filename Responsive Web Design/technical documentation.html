            <p>
                Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                It is used for:

            <li>web development (server-side),</li>
            <li>software development</li>
            <li>mathematics,</li>
            <li>system scripting.  </li> 
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
            Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
            Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
            Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
            Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

                <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.
                    To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
                </p>
                <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>
                <p>If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website:
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/">here</a></p>

                </header>
                <p> Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
                <pre>
                    >>> print("Hello, World!")
                    Hello, World!</pre>

            <header>
                Comments
            </header>
            <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</p>

                <p>can be used to make the code more readable.</p> 
                
                <p>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
                <P>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</P>
                <br><code>#This is a comment
                    print("Hello, World!")</code>
                <p>Multiline comments also exists in python</p>

            <section class = "main-section" id = "Variable">
                <header >Variable</header>
            <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.
                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
                <code>x = 5
                    y = "John"
                    print(x)
                    print(y)</code>
            <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
            <pre>x = 4       # x is of type int
                
                x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

                print(x)</pre>

            <section class = "main-section" id = "Data_Types">
                <header >Data Types</header>
            <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.
                Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.</p>
            <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
            <pre>
                Text Type:	str
                Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
                Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
                Mapping Type:	dict
                Set Types:	set, frozenset
                Boolean Type:	bool
                Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview</pre>

            <section class = "main-section" id ="Conditionals">
                <header >Conditionals</header>
            <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
            <li>Equals: a == b</li>
            <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
            <li>Less than: a < b</li>
            <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
            <li>Greater than: a > b</u>
            <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
            <p>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</p>
            <pre>
                a = 33
                b = 200
                if b > a:
                    print("b is greater than a")
            </pre>
            <p>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
            <pre>
                a = 33
                b = 33
                if b > a:
                    print("b is greater than a")
                elif a == b:
                    print("a and b are equal")
            </pre>
            <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
            <pre>
                a = 200
                b = 33

                <header >Loops</header>
            <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:
                while loops & for loops
            </p>
            <code>i = 1</code><br>
            <code>while i < 6:</code><br>
            <code>  print(i)</code><br>
            <code>  i += 1</code>

            <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</p>
            <pre>
                fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
